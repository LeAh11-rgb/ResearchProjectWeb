    You are being invited to take part in a research project. Before you decide whether to take part it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what participation will involve. <br> Please take time to read the following information carefully. <br>
    Contact us via email (zcjtwux@ucl.ac.uk) prior to starting the tasks if there is anything that is not clear or for any other information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part. Thank you for reading this.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>
            1. What is this project's purpose?
        </strong>
        <p> 
    We are investigating how people make decisions. 
    <br>
    The experiment comprises a single session lasting approximately 5 minutes. Before each task you will read instructions on how to perform the task.
        </p>
        <br>
        <strong>
            2. Why have I been chosen?
        </strong>
        <p> 
    You have been chosen because you are aged 18-70 and you do not have any disorders that impact the way you make decision. Please let the experimenter know if this is not the case.
        </p>
        <br>
        <strong>
            3. Do I have to take part?
        </strong>
        <p> 
    It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. You can withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without it affecting any benefits that you are entitled to. If you decide to withdraw you should contact us if you wish your data to be deleted.
        </p>
        <br>
        <strong>
            4. What are the benefits of taking part?
        </strong>
        <p> 
    Whilst there are no immediate benefits for those people participating in the project, this work will help us to better understand how people make decisions based on available information. This may, in time, help us to better understand how decisions are made.
        </p>
        <br>
        <strong>
            5. What if something goes wrong?
        </strong>
        <p> 
    If you are unhappy about any aspect of the experiment, or wish to inform us of any negative experiences related to the experiment then you may end the experiment by terminating the browser. Alternatively, at any time after the experiment you may contact the supervisor (Prof. Henrik Singmann; h.singmann@ucl.ac.uk) or the Chair of the UCL Research Ethics Committee (ethics@ucl.ac.uk).
        </p>
        <br>
        <strong>
            6. Will my taking part in this project be kept confidential?
        </strong>
        <p>
    All the information that we collect about you during the course of the research will be kept strictly confidential. You will not be able to be identified in any ensuing reports or publications. We may keep information about your identity (i.e. your name), but this will be stored separately from all the other data that we collect, and will only be accessible to members of the research team. Anonymised versions of your data may be shared with other scientists. Please email the experimenter if you have any concerns about confidentiality. At the end of the experiment we may ask for your email so that we can contact you about future experiments. Providing this information will be optional.
        </p>
        <br>
        <strong>
            7. Limits to confidentiality. 
        </strong>
        <p> 
    Confidentiality will be respected unless there are compelling and legitimate reasons for this to be breached. If this was the case we would inform you of any decisions that might limit your confidentiality. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <strong>
